# task-5-Titanic-EDA
Titanic Survival Prediction â€“ Python Analysis
This repository contains my solution for the Titanic Dataset Analysis using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. This task explores data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and survival prediction using basic machine learning models.

Objective
To analyze passenger data from the Titanic shipwreck and build a model to predict which passengers were more likely to survive, based on features such as age, sex, class, and fare.

Tasks Covered
Importing and understanding the Titanic dataset

Cleaning and preprocessing data (handling missing values, encoding categorical data)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Feature engineering and selection

Building and evaluating basic models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees)

Interpreting and visualizing model results

Outcome
This project helped me apply foundational data science skills, including:

Data cleaning and EDA

Binary classification techniques

Interpreting model accuracy

Communicating insights through visualizations
